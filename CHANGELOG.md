# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) once it reaches
1.0. While pre-1.0, minor versions may contain breaking changes.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- GitHub issue and PR templates.
- Separate CI job that typechecks and builds the `web/` showcase app.
- `author`/`maintainers`/`repository` metadata in `package.json` (so the
  `SECURITY.md` reporting pointer resolves).
- `CHANGELOG.md` and `.env.example`.
- Request body-size limit in `@corridor/service` (memory-DoS guard).
- Explicit SEP-31 lifecycle status mapping (`mapSep31Status`) plus contract-shape
  tests for the adapter.
- Env-gated integration test against a real SEP-31 server (`tests/integration/`).
- `docs/operations.md` (runbook) and `docs/sep-coverage.md` (SEP-31 vs SEP-6/24).
- `IdempotencyStore.create()` — an atomic claim (conditional `INSERT … ON
CONFLICT DO NOTHING` in Postgres) implemented by both stores, plus regression
  tests for the concurrent-claim path.
- `PrometheusMetrics` — a zero-dependency `Metrics` sink that renders Prometheus
  text exposition, plus a `metricsText` option on `@corridor/service` that serves
  it at `GET /metrics` (public + unmetered). Runbook gains a Metrics & alerting
  section with `held`/`failed` alert rules.
- Pluggable rate limiting: a `RateLimiter` interface and `rateLimiter` service
  option so a shared (e.g. Redis) limiter can replace the per-process
  `TokenBucket` for multi-replica deployments.
- `gracefulShutdown(server)` helper to drain in-flight requests on SIGTERM/SIGINT.
- One-command testnet runner (`pnpm testnet` → `examples/run-testnet.ts`) wiring
  the real adapter + submitter + Postgres store to capture a live run; refuses
  mainnet without `CORRIDOR_ALLOW_MAINNET=1`.
- Live-Postgres integration test for `PostgresIdempotencyStore` (concurrent
  `create()`, version-guarded `put()`), gated on `CORRIDOR_TEST_DATABASE_URL`,
  with a Postgres service-container CI job.
- The `web/` API route now proxies to a real `@corridor/service` when
  `CORRIDOR_SERVICE_URL` is set; the in-repo simulation is fenced as demo-only.
- README status badges (CI, license, Node).
- One-command service runner (`pnpm serve` → `examples/run-service.ts`) wiring
  the real adapter/submitter/store behind `createService().server().listen()`
  — previously the service was importable but nothing ever started it. Serves
  every corridor manifest in `corridors/`, skipping `network: public` lanes
  unless `CORRIDOR_ALLOW_MAINNET=1`.
- An on-page "build-time snapshot, not a live liveness feed" label on the web
  dashboard's Corridors section — the underlying data was already disclosed in
  a code comment, now it's visible on the page itself.
- Dedicated unit tests for `@corridor/cli`, `@corridor/router`, and
  `@corridor/adapter-kit` — previously exercised only incidentally through
  other packages' tests; `conformanceSuite` had no coverage that actually ran
  in CI.
- `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `.github/dependabot.yml` (npm + github-actions,
  weekly), and a `feature_request.yml` issue template.
- `"engines": {"node": ">=22"}` in every package.json (root, `web/`, and all
  workspace packages), matching `.nvmrc` and the README's Node badge.
- SHA-pinned the GitHub Actions used in CI (previously floating `@v4` tags),
  plus new `codeql.yml` and `dependency-review.yml` workflows.
- `nightly-live-anchor.yml`: re-runs the opt-in live-anchor integration test
  on a schedule; inert until anchor secrets are configured.
- `docs/grant-proposal.md`: SCF Tier-2 draft with milestones mapped to
  ROADMAP.md/MAINTAINER.md; budget figures left as explicit placeholders.

### Fixed

- **Concurrent double-settlement window in the idempotency gate.** `execute()`
  previously gated on `get()` alone, so two callers racing the same
  `idempotencyKey` could both pass the check and both settle on-chain (the
  `put()` version guard only prevents the stored row from going backwards, not
  two in-flight runs). `execute()` now atomically claims the key via
  `store.create()` before any work and returns `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT` to the
  loser. Addresses the double-settlement scope item in `SECURITY.md`.
- **Unbounded memory in the rate limiter.** The `TokenBucket` map never evicted
  client entries (and the key can be a spoofable `X-Forwarded-For`), an
  exhaustion vector. It now evicts fully-refilled idle buckets (behaviour-neutral)
  and keys off a transport-resolved client IP rather than a raw header — see
  `trustProxy`.
- A thrown error inside the HTTP request handler (e.g. an unreachable idempotency
  DB) now returns `500` instead of hanging the socket / risking a process crash.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-18

Initial public release: the walking skeleton.

### Added

- `@corridor/types` — `Outcome<T>` no-throw result type and decimal-safe `Money`.
- `@corridor/manifest` — Zod schema + loader for a `*.corridor.yaml`; the corridor
  abstraction.
- `@corridor/adapter-kit` — `AnchorAdapter` port, conformance probes, mock adapter.
- `@corridor/sep31` — one adapter for any standards-compliant SEP-31 anchor
  (SEP-10 auth + SEP-12 KYC; crypto behind an injected signer).
- `@corridor/stellar` — settlement submitter + SEP-10 signer; `ExternalSigner`
  (KMS/HSM) port.
- `@corridor/router` — `RouteResolver` seam + static default.
- `@corridor/engine` — corridor-agnostic orchestration of quote → comply → settle
  → reconcile → recover, with a persisted state machine, crash-resume, recovery,
  audit trail, metrics hooks, and a durable Postgres idempotency store.
- `@corridor/service` — thin HTTP API over the engine (API-key auth, rate limit).
- `@corridor/cli` — manifest validation and an offline runnability `plan`.
- Reference, MX/Bitso, and NG→CN corridor manifests.
- Docs: key management, "why not Anchor Platform".

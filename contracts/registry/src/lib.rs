#![no_std]
//! # corridor-registry
//!
//! An on-chain, permissionless-to-READ registry of SEP conformance facts about
//! Stellar anchors: which SEPs a domain actually serves, the hash of the
//! `stellar.toml` those facts were read from, which conformance probes passed,
//! and — critically — the ledger at which someone last checked.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Off-ramp scarcity is the binding constraint on Stellar cross-border payments,
//! and today the only way to find out whether an anchor really serves SEP-31
//! receive-side is to go and ask it. Every operator repeats that work privately,
//! and nobody can point at a shared, timestamped answer. This contract is that
//! shared answer.
//!
//! ## What is deliberately NOT here
//!
//! Facts only. No health score, no ranking, no routing weight, no opinion about
//! which anchor you should use. Those are judgements, they depend on your own
//! risk appetite and volumes, and they belong in whatever resolver you plug into
//! your engine — not in a public record everyone reads. The split is the point:
//! verifiable facts are the public good, the interpretation is the product.
//!
//! ## Staleness is a first-class value, not an omission
//!
//! Every record carries `attested_ledger`. An attestation from 400,000 ledgers
//! ago is not wrong, it is *old*, and a consumer must be able to see that
//! difference without trusting the writer to have removed stale rows. Anything
//! that hides age would reproduce the exact failure this project is correcting:
//! reporting a lane as healthy because a string was present, rather than because
//! someone checked.
//!
//! Writes are restricted to a single configured attester contract, which holds
//! the authorisation policy. See the `attester` crate.

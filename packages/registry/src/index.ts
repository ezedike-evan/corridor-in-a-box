// @corridor/registry — read the on-chain anchor conformance registry.
//
// The registry answers one question honestly: for a given anchor domain, which
// SEPs does it advertise, which conformance probes actually passed, and how long
// ago did anyone check? It holds facts, not opinions — no score, no ranking, no
// recommendation. Deciding which anchor to route through is the job of a
// RouteResolver, and that judgement is deliberately not on chain.
//
// READS ONLY. Writing goes through the attester contract and requires an
// enrolled key; a consumer of this package never needs one.

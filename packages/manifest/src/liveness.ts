// Liveness — can this corridor actually move money, and do we KNOW that?
//
// The distinction this file exists to enforce: a manifest naming an endpoint is
// not evidence the endpoint exists. Anyone can write
//
//     transfer_server_sep31: https://anchor.example.mx/sep31
//
// into a YAML file. Reporting that lane as "runnable" because the string is
// non-empty is how tooling ends up asserting a fictional corridor is healthy.
//
// So liveness has FOUR states, not two:
//
//   not-runnable  a required endpoint is missing outright — cannot settle
//   unverified    endpoints are present but nobody has confirmed they resolve
//   verified      endpoints were checked against the anchor's published
//                 stellar.toml (or a running instance) on a recorded date
//   proven        canary payment through this exact lane reached completed within
//                 the last max_age_days, with evidence recorded in manifest proof block
//
// Only `verified` and `proven` are green/runnable. `unverified` is the honest default for any lane
// whose endpoints have not been looked at, and it is where every corridor
// starts. Earning `verified` requires setting `endpoints_verified_at` on the
// dest anchor, which a human does only after actually checking. Earning `proven`
// requires a fresh proof block.

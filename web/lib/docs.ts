    body: `# Overview

**corridor-in-a-box** is an open, manifest-driven engine for Stellar **SEP-31**
cross-border corridors. A corridor is _configuration, not code_: the engine runs
\`quote → comply → settle → reconcile → recover\` over any standards-compliant
anchor pair, and adding a new corridor is a new \`*.corridor.yaml\` file — not a fork.

> No smart contract required. SEP-31 is off-chain orchestration of a single
> **native** Stellar payment (the settle leg).

## The three boundaries

1. **engine ↔ manifest** — the engine contains no corridor-specific strings.
   Corridor #2 is a YAML file, not a code change.
2. **engine ↔ adapters** — the engine knows only the \`AnchorAdapter\` interface;
   every standards-compliant anchor shares one adapter.
3. **router seam** — the open repo ships a \`RouteResolver\` interface plus two
   resolvers: \`StaticRouteResolver\` (trust the manifest) and
   \`RegistryRouteResolver\` (require a fresh on-chain attestation). A
   health-/rate-weighted resolver could be supplied as a separate proprietary
   component, but none is included or injected today. The interface is an
   extension seam, not evidence that such a component exists.

\`\`\`bash
corepack enable && pnpm install
pnpm lint        # eslint + prettier
pnpm typecheck   # whole monorepo, one tsc pass
pnpm test        # vitest: engine, manifest, money, sep31, stellar, service
pnpm example     # run a payment end-to-end (mocked anchor + settle)
pnpm cli plan corridors/reference.corridor.yaml   # offline liveness check
\`\`\`

\`pnpm example\` walks a payment through every state and proves idempotency:

\`\`\`
created -> quoted -> compliant -> opened -> verifying -> settling -> settled -> reconciled -> completed
replay with same key -> idempotent return (state=completed)
\`\`\`

## This web app

\`\`\`bash
cd web
pnpm install
pnpm dev   # http://localhost:3000

The **Run a payment** page drives a simulation of the engine's state machine (a
re-implementation; it can drift). Set \`CORRIDOR_SERVICE_URL\` to drive a real
\`@corridor/service\`.

packages/
  types/         Outcome<T> result type + decimal-safe Money
  manifest/      Zod schema for a corridor + loader
  adapter-kit/   AnchorAdapter port + conformance probes + mock adapter
  sep31/         ONE generic adapter (SEP-10 auth + SEP-12 KYC)
  stellar/       the only money-path package that touches the chain:
                 settlement submitter + SEP-10 signer
  router/        RouteResolver seam — open interface + static default
  engine/        orchestration: state machine, crash-resume, recovery, audit, metrics
  service/       thin HTTP API over the engine (auth + rate limiting)
  cli/           validate a manifest; print an offline runnability plan
  probe/         probe an anchor's SEP conformance from its stellar.toml
  registry/      read conformance attestations from the on-chain registry
  attester/      submit probe results to the registry via the attester contract
contracts/       Soroban registry + attester contracts
\`\`\`

\`stellar/\` is the only package on the money path that touches the chain.
\`probe/\`, \`registry/\` and \`attester/\` read and write the conformance
registry; they never move funds.

## The five verbs

| Step | Verb | Standard |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | quote | SEP-38 \`POST /quote\` |
| 2 | comply | SEP-10 auth + SEP-12 KYC handoff |
| 3 | open | SEP-31 \`POST /transactions\` |
| 4 | settle | native Stellar payment of the bridge asset |
| 5 | reconcile | SEP-31 \`GET /transactions/:id\` |

## The state machine

A persisted state machine drives \`created → quoted → compliant → opened →
verifying → settling → settled → reconciled → completed\`. Every transition is logged,
audited, and counted. The full table, from \`packages/engine/src/state.ts\`:

| State | Possible next states |
|---|---|
| \`created\` | \`quoted\`, \`failed\` |
| \`quoted\` | \`compliant\`, \`recovering\`, \`failed\` |
| \`compliant\` | \`opened\`, \`recovering\`, \`failed\` |
| \`opened\` | \`verifying\`, \`recovering\`, \`failed\` |
| \`verifying\` | \`settling\`, \`failed\` |
| \`settling\` | \`settled\`, \`retrying\`, \`recovering\`, \`failed\` |
| \`retrying\` | \`verifying\`, \`recovering\`, \`failed\` |
| \`settled\` | \`reconciled\`, \`recovering\`, \`failed\` |
| \`reconciled\` | \`completed\`, \`failed\` |
| \`recovering\` | \`refund_pending\`, \`refunded\`, \`held\`, \`failed\` |
| \`refund_pending\` | \`refunded\`, \`held\`, \`failed\` |
| \`completed\` | terminal |
| \`refunded\` | terminal |
| \`held\` | terminal |
| \`failed\` | terminal |

\`retrying\` is entered only when a settle attempt failed before money moved,
and is the only state that may re-enter \`verifying\`. \`recovering\` and
\`refund_pending\` can be entered after settlement, so neither can reach
\`settling\` — a double-spend is unreachable by construction.

\`@corridor/service\` turns the engine library into a service (zero runtime deps,
Node \`http\`).

## \`POST /payments\`

Body is a \`PaymentIntent\`:

\`\`\`json

| \`409\` | \`KYC_REQUIRED\` | Customer KYC incomplete or customer action required |
| \`413\` | \`payload too large\` | Request body exceeds \`maxBodyBytes\` cap (default 64 KiB) |
| \`422\` | \`AMOUNT_INVALID\` | Amount is not a positive decimal or cannot be settled |
| \`422\` | \`MANIFEST_INVALID\` | Corridor manifest validation failed |
| \`429\` | \`rate_limited\` | Token-bucket rate limit exceeded for client IP or API key |
| \`500\` | \`SETTLEMENT_FAILED\` | On-chain Stellar payment transaction failed |
| \`500\` | \`RECONCILE_MISMATCH\` | Settled amounts or assets do not match anchor transaction record |
| \`500\` | \`internal\` | Unexpected server error or unhandled failure fallback |
| \`501\` | \`REFUND_UNSUPPORTED\` | Payment failed and anchor does not support refund |
| \`502\` | \`QUOTE_UNAVAILABLE\` | Origin or destination anchor failed to provide a quote |
| \`502\` | \`ANCHOR_UNAVAILABLE\` | Upstream anchor service unreachable or returned an upstream error |
| \`504\` | \`SETTLEMENT_TIMEOUT\` | Stellar network submission timed out |
| \`504\` | \`RECONCILE_STALLED\` | Anchor transaction polling timed out |

## Other endpoints

- \`GET /payments/:key\` — current run state (scoped to authenticated tenant).
- \`GET /healthz\` — liveness (public, unmetered).
- \`GET /metrics\` — Prometheus text exposition format (public, unmetered; served when \`metricsText\` is configured).

Optional bearer **API-key** auth and an in-memory **token-bucket** rate limiter
are configured on the service context.

The distribution account's seed is the most sensitive thing in a deployment.
All key access is isolated behind one port so the seed never has to live in the

| **Production** | A KMS/HSM-backed \`ExternalSigner\` | In the vault; never in the app |

A KMS/HSM that supports ed25519 implements \`ExternalSigner\` by delegating
\`sign\` to the vault, so the application only ever sees the public key and a
finished signature. Rotate keys on a schedule; because callers depend on the

\`corridor-in-a-box\` is the **orchestrator an operator runs** to _drive a payment
across two anchors_ and move the on-chain bridge asset between them. They are
complementary — in a real lane the receiving anchor runs the Anchor Platform and
this engine talks to it.
